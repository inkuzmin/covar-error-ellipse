# D3 covariance error ellipse

> Check the result at [GitHub Pages](https://inkuzmin.github.io/covar-error-ellipse) or [Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/ca5fdc0c2f8926a3).

This demo is based on "[How to plot a covariance error ellipse](https://www.xarg.org/2018/04/how-to-plot-a-covariance-error-ellipse/)" article written by *Robert Eisele* and "[How to draw a covariance error ellipse?](http://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/draw-error-ellipse-representing-covariance-matrix/)" article written by *Vincent Spruyt*. Check the articles for the detailed description of mathematics behind it, it's amazingly interesting!

## NB
- D3 *v4* is used in this demo, although it should work equally well with D3 *v5*.
- For the sake of convenience I am using *ES6* syntax and higher order functions here. Traditional for-loops might be a more efficient solution for huge datasets.
